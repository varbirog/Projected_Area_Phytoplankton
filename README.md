## Highlights
- The application of Coachy’s formula for concave forms highly overestimates their projected areas (Ā).
- Using a numerical approach and computer simulation, Ā can be accurately calculated for all microalgae.
- Models describing morphological metric-projected area relationships provide only rough estimates for Ā.
- Morphology can cause up to a sixfold variation in Ā for the same volume.
- Filamentous forms and loosely packed colonies are the most efficient adaptations to maximize Ā.

## Abstract
Projected (shaded) area (Ā) is a crucial morphological trait of microalgae, influencing light acquisition and sinking properties. However, species-specific Ā values are currently unavailable. Although Ā can be analytically calculated for convex shapes using surface area data, such data are missing from microalgae databases. Additionally, no established method exists for calculating the projected area of concave shapes.

This study proposes a probabilistic numerical approach and computer simulation to determine Ā for all 3D objects. We created shape-realistic 3D models of over 800 microalgae and placed them in a virtual space. Utilizing a virtual orthogonal camera system and a probabilistic optimization framework, we measured and calculated their projected areas. Our approach was validated against convex shapes using the analytical Ā = surface area/4 formula, achieving an estimation bias of less than 5%.

We demonstrated that morphological differences among species can result in up to sixfold variations in Ā for the same volume. We further analyzed how Ā values correlate with previously proposed morphological metrics (e.g., compactness, relative surface area extension, relative elongation, Gald/width ratio, surface area constant, volume constant). While the applied models explained a significant portion of the variance, the large scatter prevents accurate estimates for Ā.

We identified spindle-form, filamentous, and loosely packed coenobial colonies as the most effective adaptations for maximizing Ā. This study presents an innovative methodology and a dataset containing Ā values for 844 planktic freshwater microalgae. Though limited to species from the Pannonian and Dinaric ecoregions, the dataset is applicable to other regions due to the cosmopolitan nature of planktic algae. Our findings enhance the understanding of phytoplankton functionality and contribute to improved predictive models for their compositional changes.
